                    <p> Asarewaa Kwateng is an artist, whose work is often focused on exploring the spaces where communities are formed involuntarily.
                    These are the spaces where people come together not necessarily by choice, but rather by circumstance or necessity.
                    They are the places where individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences are brought together and find a way to coexist and interact at a time.</p>

                    <p> These spaces can take many forms, from hair dressing salons, market places, bus stations amongst others.
                    They are places where people are forced to confront the realities of their differences and find a way to build community despite them.</p> 

                    <p> She is fascinated by salon spaces, interactions and activities that go on there.
                    She paints hairstyles and activities that take place in these spaces with brightly colored backgrounds that are inspired by the city's saturated colors, personalities of these people, colours that make up these settings and also reference local salon signages and catalogues.
                    Writings are sometimes used to incorporate conversations from the spaces into the paintings.</p>
